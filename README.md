# Sudoku Solver 🎲

## About ℹ️

> **Sudoku Solver** is a **C# Console Application** that gets random **Pattern** and uses algorithm to see if its solveable.
>
> If there is a possible **solve** the program prints the **solved sudoku** in a **fancy** way.
>
> The application uses **Backtracking**.
>
> When the **algorithm** completes you can choose if you want to see the **simulation** behind the algorithm and all the steps it does in order to solve the **sudoku**.

## How it works? ❔

> #### First the program gets the starting sudoku pattern.
>
> #### Then we start the algorithm.
>
> #### The algorithm checks if the number we try to set is valid in the position.
>
> #### If all those are false we put the number and repeat until we find a solution.
>
> #### When the algorithm is done, you can choose if you want to see simulation of the run.
